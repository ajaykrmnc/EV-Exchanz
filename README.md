## Introduction
In the era of electric vehicles, it is essential to provide a seamless charging infrastructure for their optimal usage. Our solution aims to address this challenge by leveraging the Google Maps API to locate nearby e-stations and connect them to partnered gas station masters. Users can prebook charging slots, ensuring a hassle-free experience.

## Features
- Locate nearby e-stations using the Google Maps API
- Connect e-stations with partnered gas station masters
- Prebook charging slots
- Seamless and secure authentication system
- Integrated payment gateway for convenient transactions
- Partnership opportunities for interested parties

## Tech Stack
The solution is built using the following technologies:

- **Front-end**: MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
- **Deployment**: Netlify
- **Authentication**: Firebase
- **Payment Gateway**: Slice

## Deployment
The project is deployed on Netlify and can be accessed at [xparkle.netlify.app](https://xparkle.netlify.app).

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd repository`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application.

## Authentication
We have implemented Firebase authentication to ensure secure user access to the platform. Users can create an account, log in, and manage their personal information securely.

## Payment Gateway
For seamless and secure transactions, we have integrated the Slice payment gateway. Users can conveniently make payments for their charging slots through the platform.

## Partnership Opportunities
We believe in collaboration and are open to partnerships with interested parties. If you are a gas station master or have any other business proposal related to the e-vehicle industry, we encourage you to reach out to us. Let's work together to create a greener future!
